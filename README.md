## Reflections on the framework 

> 3/26/19

VueJS is a simplistic and flexible framework that takes the best of Angular and React and brings it together in one.

If you’re brand new to Javascript frameworks, this is the way to go. 
VueJS creator, [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803/), is requiring you to only know es5 Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Don't have any experience with Javascript or any functional language? Don't worry it supports Typescript too. 

### When to use VueJS

VueJS should be used for small-medium sized applications. Despite the benefits it doesn't come in one big package like Angular. This offers the risk for more security vulnerabilities and community dependence. 

### Familiar tools to expect in VueJS

|Angular|React|
|:--:|:--:|
|2 way data binding|Virtual DOM|
|Directives|Single File Components|
|CLI|Redux with Vuex|
|Typescript|Smaller core bundle with several external modules|
|Template errors on load||


### Additional VueJS Pros

* You don’t have to manually inject all of your components into a core module.
* You don't have to learn [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) or [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* A [VueJs Browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) that allows you to view and change live data in your components.
* Start using VueJS with one script tag.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
```

### Thoughts going forward

VueJS was by far the easiest framework for me to pick up. Following the strategy of waiting and learning from the mistakes of Angular and React has me excited for it's future. Now that the creator can dedicate full time to this project, I hope he continues to grow his [team](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/team.html) to help push this to be the next big framework.
